This project focuses on creating an information retrieval system using a vector space model to rank documents based on relevance. Key elements include implementing text preprocessing techniques, such as stop-word removal and stemming, and applying TF-IDF for term weighting. Cosine similarity is used to rank documents against query terms, providing a refined approach to retrieving the most relevant documents.
